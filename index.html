        <h2>What are Pocket Monsters?</h2>
        <p>
          Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and
          published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon
          media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
          Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy,
          and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred
          as the "core series" by their developers

            <h4>Water</h4>
            <p>
              Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire
              and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This
              creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to
              new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon,
              which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling
              creatures.

            <h4>Fire</h4>
            <p>
              Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water
              and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This
              creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to
              new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages
              of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a
              plus.

              creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to
              new players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with
              5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass
              moves.

          <p>The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In<br> the process of getting out their doors and visiting parks, players found they<br> were losing weight almost in spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan<br> won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and<br> December.</p>
          <p>Pokémon GO is one of the most successful mobile games of all time, breaking<br> records like fastest to earn $100 million and most-downloaded in its first month<br> of release. To date, it has grossed almost $2 billion in revenue and been<br>downloaded 800 million times. Although no longer the global phenomenon it<br> was in 2016, the game remains incredibly popular.</p>

          <p>Greninja is the final evolution of Pokémon X and Y water-type starter Froakie. It has the ability to<br> take on an appearance resembling its trainer. Pokedex says: Greninja creates throwing stars out<br> of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split<br> metal in two.</p>

        <div style="position: relative; bottom:1000px;left:100px;">
          <p>Lucario is a bipedal, wolf-like Pokémon with blue, cream, and black fur. It is considered to be<br> prideful and loyal to its trainer. Pokedex says: By catching the aura emanating from others,<br> Lucario can read their thoughts and movements.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="position: relative;bottom:750px;left:120px;">
          <p>Mimikyu caused quite a stir for its peculiar looks and sad backstory when it was originally<br> announced for Pokémon Sun and Moon in 2016. Mimikyu is described as a Pokémon who felt so<br> lonely that it decided to wear a rag in order to look like Pikachu, everyone’s favorite Pokémon.<br> Pokedex says: Its actual appearance is unknown. A scholar who saw what was under its rag was<br> overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock.</p>

        <div style="position:relative; bottom:500px;left:110px;">
          <p>Charizard is an orange draconic Pokémon who has a fiery temper. It is the final evolution of<br> Charmander, one of the starter Pokémon for the original game. Pokedex says: Charizard flies<br> around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts<br> anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.</p>

          <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>We&#39;re sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but<br> you should also be well versed in the rodent&#39;s evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of<br> generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you&#39;ve bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers<br> should be able to answer.</li>
            <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
          </ul><br>
          <li>What&#39;s the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There&#39;s the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you&#39;re<br> looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you&#39;ve made your way through any Pokemon game,<br> you&#39;ve reached the point where you&#39;re presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button<br> mashing at all is required.</li>
            <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

            <p>Pokémon Go&#39;s Types are exactly the same<br> as those in the main Pokémon games, but<br> the effect of those type matchups is slightly<br> different: in brief, things like effective or<br> resisted attacks have slightly different<br> multipliers to the main Pokémon games -<br> although a December 2018 update brought<br> them slightly closer in line.</p>
